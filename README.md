# X201 Coreboot ROM

This is my Coreboot ROM. The ME is enabled due to the lack of fan support.

# Disclaimers

I do not own any Lenovo logos, artwork, or trademarks. Example being the "ThinkPad" trademark and the exploded internals for the X201 found on page 142 of the X201 Hardware Maintenance Manual.
